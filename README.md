# My SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey of learning SQL using the AdventureWorks database. This collection showcases the progress I've made through various SQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced levels.

## About This Repository

This repository captures my personal exploration and understanding of SQL. Here, you'll find my practice queries, challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. It's a reflection of my growth in SQL and a way to keep track of my learning milestones.

## AdventureWorks Database

I chose the AdventureWorks database for its rich dataset and variety of tables, which provide ample opportunities to practice different SQL concepts.

## Learning Resources

### Video Tutorials

1. **Installing Sample Data**:
   - [AdventureWorks Installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAlQfpjPOEA&ab_channel=SQLServer101): This video helped me install the AdventureWorks sample database.

2. **Basic SQL Concepts**:
   - [SQL Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=6s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org): I used this video to learn some foundational SQL concepts.

### Online Courses

- **Data Analysis Course**:
  - [Intermediate and Advanced SQL Queries](https://www.udemy.com/share/10bEjb3@fkxdM1LZ_VOt4g4DFSU_Qx9RZGRQGEGfdGV83inbqoF29N9kVpIqSvSTgcMbTk-kFw==/): This course has been instrumental in enhancing my skills in intermediate and advanced SQL queries.

### Additional Resources

- **W3Schools**: I referred to W3Schools to clarify concepts when I was confused.
  
- **SQLZoo**: I practiced running complex queries using the [SQLZoo Tutorial](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

## Learning Sections

I've organized my SQL practice into three main sections:

1. **Basic Queries**: 
   - Simple SELECT statements
   - Filtering data
   - Basic sorting

2. **Intermediate Queries**: 
   - Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
   - Grouping and aggregation
   - Subqueries

3. **Advanced Queries**: 
   - Window functions
   - Complex joins
   - Performance optimization

## Progress Tracking

Throughout this journey, I've documented my process and the queries I've written. Feel free to browse through the folders to see my progress and the different SQL concepts I've explored.

## Future Goals

As I continue to learn, I aim to deepen my understanding of SQL and explore advanced topics like database design and performance tuning. This repository will be updated with new queries and insights as I progress.
